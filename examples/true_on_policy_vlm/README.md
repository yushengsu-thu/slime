# True On-Policy between Training and Inference for VLM

This example demonstrates true on-policy training with Qwen3-VL dense model on FSDP. The core concepts and expected observations are the same as [true_on_policy](../true_on_policy/README.md).

## Usage

```bash
python examples/true_on_policy_vlm/run_simple.py
```
